This is the first "real" website I've built. The project is part of The
Odin Project's curriculum, and the aim is to clone Google's homepage
(only the look-and-feel, without implementing any actual search engine
features).

Did everything from scratch, without inspecting any code from the real 
Google homepage. Lots of Google searching and trial-and-error went into 
it though.
